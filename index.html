<h1>The Operating Systems</h1>

 <p style="font-size:22px">An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer.
 It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.
 It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.
 Without an operating system, a computer is useless.</p>
 
 <h1>The operating system's job</h1> 
 
 <p style="font-size:22px">Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. 
 Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time,
 and they all need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. 
 The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.</p>

    <td>LINUX is much moddern than the previous ones as it invented by Finnish in 1990s , the reason which make it appear on the field is that is different from both windows and macOS as its open source system which mean that its easier to be customised by the user , on the other hand , windows and macOS can be customised only by the company ( Microsoft & Apple ) , however the total number of users don't exceed 2% from the total number of users of operating systems</td>
