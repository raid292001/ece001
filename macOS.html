<h1>The macOS</h1>

<p style="font-size:22px">macOS (previously called OS X) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. 
It comes preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs. 
Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016).
According to StatCounter Global Stats, macOS users account for less than 10% of global operating systems—much lower than 
the percentage of Windows users (more than 80%). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. 
However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.

Apple’s marketing for the introduction of the Macintosh focused heavily on its operating system’s intuitive ease of use. 
Unlike virtually all other contemporary PCs, the Mac OS (initially designated simply System Software with a version number appended) was graphically based.
Rather than typing commands and directory paths at text prompts, users moved a mouse pointer to visually 
navigate the Finder—a series of virtual folders and files, represented by icons. 
Most computer operating systems eventually adopted the GUI model. 
In the 1980s Apple made an agreement allowing Microsoft to use certain aspects of the Mac interface in early versions of Windows. 
However, except for a brief period in the 1990s, Mac OS has never been licensed for use with computers made by manufacturers other than Apple.

Later Mac OS releases introduced features such as Internet file sharing, network browsing, and multiple user accounts. 
In 1996 Apple acquired rival NeXT Computers, which was founded by Steven Jobs after his departure from Apple, 
and in 2001 the company rolled out Mac OS X, a major redesign based on both the NextStep system and Apple’s most recent OS release. 
OS X ran on a UNIX kernel (core software code) and offered technical advances such as memory protection and preemptive multitasking 
along with a more versatile Finder, an elegant-looking interface called Aqua 
and a convenient graphical “Dock” bar for launching frequently used applications. Updates to OS X added features 
such as automated backups and a “Dashboard” manager for small, handy applications called widgets.

From 2007 Apple unveiled a number of mobile devices that could access the Internet, including the iPhone smartphone and the iPad tablet computer. 
Apple soon emphasized the ability of OS X to connect with these devices. 
In 2011 Apple introduced iCloud, a cloud computing service that allowed users to share data among all of their Apple devices, for both OS X and the mobile operating system iOS. 
Apple added more features allowing connectivity between devices to successive updates of OS X, iOS, and later watchOS (the operating system for the Apple Watch smartwatch). 
These features included the ability to receive phone calls (made to the iPhone) and the means of quickly sharing data (such as photos and text) among devices.</p>
